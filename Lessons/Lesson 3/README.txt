Lesson 3:

This lesson will go over the different types of loops and basic functions

Loop types:
	While				//will run till the condition is false
	do while			//will run ONCE no matter what. then till the condition is false
	for					//will run a specific number of times, unless it is borken (loops can be exited with break whenever)
	foreach				//loops through each item of an enumerable(Lesson 4)

Function terms:
	return				//what the function spits out. its answer
	return type			//what kind of answer the function will spit out
	paramater			//what the function takes in
	default paramater	//optional paramater that has a default value
	visability			//what files can see this function (not important till you have multiple files/classes)
	void				//a return type that means nothing.
